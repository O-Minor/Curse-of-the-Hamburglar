Instructions: Runs in Python 3. It's on you to get the file to run on your computer. 

Lore: In 2019 me and my friends played a campaign of Curse of Strahd which, upon the introduction of a bugermiester quickly turned into an AU where the burgermeister was actually the hamburglar and all other NPCs were from the mac donalds extended universe. The campaign quickly dissolved because of lockdown (and friend group drama). But in 2020 me and my friend from the campaign made this game, inspired by the chaos, for our programming class. The most characters in the game (Fredrick, Alaine, Anklebiter, and Reyna) are from the original campaign, the gameplay however is not.

Enjoy.
